# What are Algorithms?

As we saw before, a generative design approach involves several distinct steps. The types of methods used in each step are very different to each other, so we generally categorise them as follows:

| Step | Algorithm Type |	
| :--- | :--- |	
| generation of new design studies | generators |	
| evaluation of each study | evaluators |	
| ranking & solution achieves goal | solvers |
